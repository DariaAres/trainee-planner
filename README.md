# Trainee planner

<img src="./readme_img/trainee-planner1.png" alt="Trainee planner" align="left"/> <br>The current development of technology makes it possible to solve absolutely unlimited range of tasks. Every day we exchange information of all kinds, but at this time the modern world is characterized by its oversaturation. Therefore, the received information volume for the day and the plan for the near future can not always "fit" in the head. In the case when there is a lot of incoming information, there is nothing more reasonable than to keep a planner.

Filling out the planner will be a real help for everyone in the series of events to structure them and "put" on the shelves. With such a gift you won't have to "extract information from the corners of your memory" - it's enough just to look into a notebook with daily notes.

The main purpose of the development of "Trainee planner" is to create an important tool that will allow you to conveniently systematize all your affairs and watch the weather. A web-based event management application that is fully meets modern requirements will display events in an easy-to-read manner.
